Key Differences

Performance: Using synchronize_session='fetch' will add an extra query to fetch the primary keys of the affected rows, which can affect performance, especially with large datasets. Using synchronize_session=False skips this step, making it more efficient.

Session State: With synchronize_session='fetch', the session will be accurately synchronized with the database, ensuring the session's state matches the database state. With synchronize_session=False, the session might contain stale data until it is expired or refreshed.

Practical Impact
If you do not need to access the deleted objects after deletion, synchronize_session=False is usually the best choice as it improves performance.
If you need to ensure the session's state is up-to-date with the database, use synchronize_session='fetch' or synchronize_session='evaluate' (with simpler queries).
In summary, the choice of synchronize_session parameter depends on your specific use case and the need for session synchronization accuracy versus performance.
